# Blueprint: Manga Website Prototype

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a prototype of a manga website based on a user-provided design. The website will feature a modern, dark-themed interface for browsing and reading manga.

## Design and Features

### General Aesthetics
*   **Theme:** Dark theme with a textured background.
*   **Color Palette:** A vibrant and energetic color palette will be used for interactive elements, with a base of dark and light colors for the main UI.
*   **Typography:** Expressive and hierarchical typography will be used to guide the user's attention.
*   **Interactivity:** Interactive elements will have "glow" effects and shadows to create a sense of depth.
*   **Layout:** The layout will be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

### Implemented Features
*   **Header:** A navigation header with the site logo and links to "Home", "Catalog", and "Cabinet".
*   **Main Page:**
    *   A section to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine (ЗСУ).
    *   A large, interactive banner for featured manga.
    *   An "Updates" section showing the latest manga chapters.
*   **Footer:** A simple footer with relevant links.
*   **Catalog Page:** A page to browse all manga titles with filtering and view options.
*   **Title Page:** A detailed page for a single manga, showing its description, genres, and chapter list.
*   **Cabinet Page:** A personal account page for users.

## Current Plan

Based on the user's new request, I will update the "Personal Account" page to match the new design. The following changes will be made:

1.  **Enhance Cabinet Page (`cabinet.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`):**
    *   Restructure the page using a tabbed interface with "Personal Account" and "History" sections.
    *   The "Personal Account" tab will display the user's bookmarked manga ("I'm following").
    *   The "History" tab will display a list of the last 5 read chapters.
    *   The "Support ZSU" block will remain a prominent feature on the page.
    *   Implement the tab switching logic in JavaScript.

By following this plan, I will enhance the personal account page to be more organized and feature-rich, as per the user's request.
